            We were provided a LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> package with parts to create three
            different assemblies. As a group, we created ID numbers for each

            then used Teamcenter to upload the items with their names, ID's, and

            toy assembled. We were able to identify items common to each toy,
            items unique, and many other facts required. We then presented our

            In my calculations for military aerodynamic component tests and the
            valve calculations, I noticed a need of a consolidated calculator
            that relies on a single set of specifications. Before, there was not
            a standard method or even calculator to size flow devices. In the
            shared folder for the team, there were many different excel
            calculators used to size venturi's, orifices, and valves.
            Oftentimes, the assumptions were not clearly stated, nor the method
            used. The methods of similar sizing calculators were also very
            different from each other and instructions were not clearly stated.
            Utilizing lean six sigma techniques, I created this excel calculator
            which utilizes VBA macros to size unchoked venturis, choked
            venturis, orifices, and valves. Each of these sub-calculators have a
            clear method described in the DRB I created and issued as well as
            clear instructions written in the excel calculator. This calculator
            has been and will be able to be used for any test, component or full
            engine.

            As a team, we were tasked to use aerospace applications to help with
            the broad problem of oil spills. We decided to narrow this down to
            create a system that would decrease the occurrences of oil spills
            while simultaneously decreasing the time that it takes to detect and
            contain oil spills. We conducted extensive research; analyzed our
            our stakeholders, needs, and requirements; generated concepts using
            tables and a house of quality; established patent-ability of our
            concepts; narrowed these concepts using Pugh matrices, risk
            assessments, fault trees and cost and value assessments to reach our
            final concept. Our team concluded that a three part system
            consisting of dyes, dispersants and flow sensors will help identify,
            counter, and prevent oil spills.

            I was assigned to a mission-based team tasked with finding the root
            cause of coking on fuel nozzles in the LEAP engines. I supported
            this mission by conducting spray visualization testing on the fuel
            nozzles. After receiving minimum overview of the test procedure and
            goals, I was sable to run the test with limited oversight. I
            developed the testing matrix and a way to easily identify the
            different types of flow spraying from each orifice from the fuel
            nozzle from videos recorded during testing. Then, I created a
            ranking system for the different types of flow for the proposed
            level of coking each type would cause in the field. After observing
            and learning the process from a principal engineer, I found a way to
            streamline the testing process by reducing the amount of data needed
            to collect during the test, completing 4 times the test points than
            before. I analyzed the videos and data collect, creating charts
            using MATLAB and Excel to visualize the results. I presented the
            data to a technical review for them to draw conclusions which
            directly impacted the root cause analysis and allowed for a
            short-term field containment design change to be identified.

          <h3>A-10 Redesign Proposal</h3>
          <p class="project-location">
            Class: Introduction to Aerospace Design

            Our team developed a proposal which offered a thoroughly analyzed
            background, description of a suitable replacement for the A-10, and
            reasoning behind why the aircraft should or should not be replaced.
            Throughout this project, our team focused on researching as much as
            possible about the A-10 to find accurate, reliable tools - such as
            formulas or appropriate aircraft parts. Although an effective attack
            aircraft, the A-10 has been in service since the 1970’s and as such
            the US Air Force has recently been looking for an affordable, safe,
            and effective replacement. In order to approach this problem, our
            team first researched the history, technical specifications, and
            design of the A-10. Then our team identified the stakeholders,
            needs, and requirements to propose a cost-effective replacement for
            the A-10. In our research and calculations, our team prioritized
            minimizing the weight of the A-10. The primary goals in creating a
            replacement for the A-10 were to increase maneuverability and
            decrease structural load on the wings of the new aircraft. After
            research, design, and calculations, this feasible new aircraft could
            likely be more effective than the A-10, specifically regarding
            providing better close air support than the A-10. Since the main
            differences that our team could adjust in this new aircraft would be
            the airfoils and engine used, the proposed aircraft would use NACA
            4415 airfoil and a CFE738 engine. Finally, our team found that the
            new proposed aircraft would be a compelling replacement for the
            A-10.

            The LEAP combustor manufacturing team had a need to standardize
            their processes in order to better predict shipments and stay on a
            consistent schedule. I started on the first “island”, specifically
            the welding operations. I spent hours videotaping operators of every
            shift on each of the 11 welding operations. With all 33 videos
            created, I held a meeting with all operators who wanted to help to
            go over the videos. Each meeting we covered one operation, watching
            all three videos while marking down the time taken for each step.
            Then, the operators would discuss the most fair and attainable time
            to create the highest quality product for each step based on these
            recorded times. Once they agreed on a standard work, I organized the
            agreement to a document signed by an engineer. We documented each
            standard work and distributed it to the floor as an expectation. The
            coaches would audit these processes based on the standard work in
            order to track delays and quickly identify problems.
